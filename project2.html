<h3>Desciption</h3>

<p>
   <h3>Overview :-</h3> <br>
    The Student Database Management System is a sophisticated application developed <br>
    using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in Python, with data stored in <br>
    JSON files. This project highlights my ability to design and implement a system <br>
    that efficiently manages student records for both 10th and 12th grade students, <br>
    allowing for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on student data.<br>
    <br>
    <h3>Features :-</h3>
    <br>
    <br>
    Add Student: Add new student records, including details such as ID, name, age, 
    grade, and subjects.<br>
    <br>
    Update Student: Update existing student information to reflect changes in academic
     or personal details.<br>
     <br>
    View Student: Retrieve and display the details of any student by their unique ID.<br>
    <br>
    Delete Student: Securely remove student records from the system.<br>
    <br>
    Data Persistence: Use JSON files to store and manage student data, ensuring 
    persistence across sessions.<br>
    <br>

    <h3>Technologies Used :-</h3>
    <br>
    <br>
    Programming Language: Python<br>
    <br>
    Concepts: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), JSON for data storage<br>
    <br>
    Libraries: json, os for file handling<br>
    <br>
    <h3>Key Components :-</h3>
    <br>
    Student Class: Defines the student entity with attributes such as ID, name, age, 
    grade, and subjects. Implements a __str__ method for easy representation of 
    student details.<br>
    <br>
    StudentDatabase Class: Manages the collection of student records, providing methods 
    for adding, updating, viewing, and deleting students. Handles data persistence using 
    JSON files.<br>
    <br>
    <h3>Project Highlights :-</h3>
    <br>
    <br>
    Efficient Data Management: Utilizes dictionaries for quick access to student records by 
    their unique IDs.<br>
    <br>
    Data Persistence with JSON: Ensures that student data is saved to and loaded from JSON files, 
    maintaining data integrity across sessions.<br>
    <br>
    Modular Design: Separation of Student and StudentDatabase classes promotes code reusability 
    and maintainability.<br>
    <br>
    Scalability: Designed to handle a growing number of student records, making it suitable for 
    large educational institutions.<br>
    <br>
